## Features

- **Code Generation:** Generate code snippets or functions based on natural language prompts.
- **Code Debugging:** Get suggestions for fixing errors in provided code.
- **Git Operation Simulation:** Simulate common Git commands and their outcomes.
- **File Analysis:** Upload and analyze text-based files (code, markdown, etc.) for summaries or insights.
- **Idea Generation:** Brainstorm creative ideas (e.g., blog posts, articles) based on keywords, presented in a structured list.
- **General Purpose AI Chat:** A dedicated chat interface for general questions, strictly avoiding code generation and redirecting to specialized tools when appropriate.
- **Conversation History:** A sidebar displaying past interactions, allowing users to revisit previous queries and results.
- **Responsive UI:** Optimized for various screen sizes, including a collapsible sidebar/navbar for mobile.

## Architecture

This project implements an **MCP (Multi-Component Processing)** server architecture, simulating distinct, specialized components for different AI functionalities.

### Key Components:

- **Frontend (Web Interface):**
    - Provides the user interface for interaction.
    - Sends user requests (prompts, files, action types) to the backend.
    - Displays AI responses and manages conversation history.
- **Backend (Django Server):**
    - Acts as the central orchestrator and API endpoint.
    - Contains the core **Agentic AI Logic** (`AgentCore` class).
    - **Planning Module:** Interprets user intent and determines the appropriate action/tool.
    - **Tool Executor:** Dispatches tasks to specialized AI tools.
    - **Memory Manager:** Stores and retrieves conversation history for context.
- **AI Tools (within Backend):**
    - `_generate_code_tool`: Interacts with LLM for code generation.
    - `_debug_code_tool`: Interacts with LLM for debugging suggestions.
    - `_execute_git_command_tool`: Interacts with LLM for simulated Git outcomes.
    - `_analyze_file_tool`: Interacts with LLM for file content analysis.
    - `_generate_ideas_tool`: Interacts with LLM for structured idea generation.
    - `_general_purpose_ai_tool`: Interacts with LLM for general information, with strict no-code constraints.
- **External LLM (Gemini AI):**
    - Provides the underlying intelligence for all AI functionalities via API calls.

### Communication Protocols:

- **Frontend ↔ Backend:** HTTP POST requests (for actions) and HTTP GET requests (for history) using `multipart/form-data` (for files) and JSON.
- **Backend ↔ LLM:** HTTPS POST requests with JSON payloads to the Google Gemini API.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Bootstrap 5), JavaScript
- **Backend:** Python 3.x, Django
- **LLM API:** Google Gemini 2.0 Flash
- **Dependencies:** `django`, `django-cors-headers`, `requests`
